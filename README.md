# Foodie

a Restaurant search app built in plain JavaScript
This was an assignment for Noroff's Front-end 2nd Year course.
We weren't allowed to use any external frameworks or libraries for the front-end so I made my own reactive view library inspired by hyperapp.

[LIVE DEMO](http://bartektelec.github.io/foodie-app/index.html)

- Bootstrap based UI
- Strapi as a back-end
- the Reactive "state" uses the Observer pattern to notify all the bound elements when it's changed
- Reactive Search bar, search for restaurant names as well as food types
- Add restaurants to favourites
- View the menu and add meals to cart
- Cart shows all added items and sums up the total price
- Favourite restaurants and shopping cart are stored in LocalStorage
- Authorization wasn't a goal in this assignment so I didn't focus on that
